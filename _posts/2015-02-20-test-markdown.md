Irrigation scheduling, or irrigation water management, ensures that water is consistently available to the plant and that it is applied according to crop requirements.
Proper irrigation scheduling will improve profitability and water use efficiency by:
1. maximizing crop yield and quality
2. decreasing water lost through deep 2. percolation and runoff; and
3. optimizing pumping costs.

To effectively schedule irrigation applications, four key pieces of information need to be known:
1. soil texture;1.
2. water holding capacity of the soil;2.
3. soil moisture content; and
4. crop water use at the specific development 4. stage.
Another factor that should be considered within a scheduling program is knowing the allowable depletion of the crop, that is how much water can be removed from the soil profile prior to stressing the crop.
The limitations of an irrigation system can impact a scheduling program, so it is necessary to be aware of how much water can be applied efficiently to the crop and the time duration required to apply a specific amount of irrigation.
This publication is intended to provide irrigators more info will be posted in the near future.
