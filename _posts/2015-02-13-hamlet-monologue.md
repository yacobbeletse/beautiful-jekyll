Plants, like all other living things, need nutrients for their growth and development. Nutrients refer to elements or chemical compounds (ions) which are required by organisms (in our case plants) for their normal growth, development, metabolism and to complete their life cycle. Research has determined that plants require 16 nutrients, also called essential elements (Marschner, 1995). Essential elements are best defined as Elements (nutrients) which are required by the plants for their normal growth and development and are not replaceable in their function by any other nutrients (Mengel, 2001). To be classified as essential element, an element needs to meet the following criteria:
1.	Omission of the element in question must result in abnormal growth, failure to complete lifecycle, or premature death of the plant
2.	The elementâ€™s function cannot be replaced by another element
3.	The element must directly involve on growth or metabolism and not some indirect effect such as by antagonizing another element present at toxic level
There are about 16 essential elements. Out of the 16 elements Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen are considered to be non-mineral nutrients as they are originated from air and water, rather than from soil minerals. Although Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen represent approximately 95% of plant biomass, they are generally given little attention in plant nutrition as they are always abundantly available. The remaining 13 of the essential elements (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Sulfur, Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Copper, Boron, Molybdenum, and Chlorine) are supplied either from soil minerals and organic matter or by organic or inorganic fertilizers.
