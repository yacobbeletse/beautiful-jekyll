Salinity of soil refers to the amount of salts in the soil and it can be estimated by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC) of an extracted soil solution. 
Soil water availability and salinity can differentially affect nutrient availability to plants. Salinity impairs the ability of plants to efficiently absorb water and nutrients from the soil. By keeping the ion concentration in the root sap higher than in the soil water, plants can maintain an inward flow of water into their roots. However, higher concentrations of salt ions in soil solution shift the concentration gradient creating osmotic stress (Figure xx). Plants in osmotic stress use more energy to maintain an inward flow of water into their roots. As a result, less energy is available for tissue growth and crop yields are reduced. This may cause nutrient deficiencies or imbalances, due to the competition of Na+ and Cl- with nutrients such as K+, Ca2+, and NO3-. Salinity can cause nutrient imbalances as a result of high concentrations of salt ions in the soil. For example, excess sodium can lead to deficiencies in magnesium and calcium.
